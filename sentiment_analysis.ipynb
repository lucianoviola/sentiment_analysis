The front pouch is perfect to carry clippers, medicine and other small stuff.  The inside pockets are perfect jars of food or for a bottle/sippy for that transition period.  Plus you'll still have room for your wallet, a couple of outfits, toys and anything else you might need.It's also a pretty good color.  It doesn't really show alot of dirty and it washes nicely.  Overall, we love the bag and wish they had it available in more colors! \n",

So you can't use each individual words as an input feature because long reviews would require a different input space than short reviews. This is where a cool trick called Bag of Words comes into rescue. The basic idea is to get a review and count the frequency of words in it and to create a dictonary of the words we are interested in mapping. Then we can match each review into a frequency count defined over the word dictionary. So in the end we have a vector (the dictionary) of size $n$ that can be applied to different reviews. This way all the input features have the same dimension. \n",
